Data Analyst Role Assessment @ CowryWise 

This file explains how I approached each business question using SQL queries, along with some challenges I faced and how I resolved them. The focus was on working with three key tables: plans_plan, savings_savingsaccount, and users_customuser.

## 1. High-Value Customers with Multiple Products
Once I identified the columns that indicates savings or investment account from the plans_plan table, then i joined the savings_savingsaccount table to retrieve the deposit amount. If balance is greater 0, then the account has been funded at least once.

## 2. Transaction Frequency Analysis

## 3. Account Inactivity Alert

## 4. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Estimation

## Challenges & Solutions
